# Taak iOS App
Focus, Achieve, Conquer - Empowering Undergraduates!

# Overview
- Taak iOS app is intended for undergraduates to focus on and visualize tasks that need to be done. This encourages undergraduates to focus on ongoing tasks with key features such as task countdown and time blocking. It also provides gamification elements with progress displays and rewards that could trigger a sense of achievement in their journey to prevent procrastination.

- The app has key features such as time blocking to help block their phone notifications and other applications (social media, games), a countdown as a timer to focus on doing their task, and a reward system (achievable digital badges and progress display) to give them points when success is focused on a certain time. This is a solution to the challenge because it helps undergraduates focus and visualize their task.
